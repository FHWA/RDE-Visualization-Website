For the public demonstration in September 2014, participants were driven in a specially instrumented demo van in a short loop on Belle Isle, Detroit, MI. Vehicle sensor data (such as GPS, wiper status, temperature, humidity, etc.) were gathered for the simulated road weather conditions.   These data triggered advisories/warning to be issued to the passengers within the van.  As the van experienced a simulated rain event, wiper status and road temperature data were captured. This data triggered the light rain ahead advisory. Slippery rubber mats engaged the van’s Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Traction Control System (TCS); these events generated data that then triggered warnings of slick roads ahead.
